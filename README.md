# TexTranslator

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  An application to directly translate a text on the screen to another language. App will ask user to create a screen box that will cover the target (text that want to be translated), then process it to get the machine-readable version of the text and put the translation result to the screen. The result will be shown directly to each of the original place of the text, removing the needs of new window as translation result container. <br><br>
  This project is made as my final project in completing informatics engineer major.
